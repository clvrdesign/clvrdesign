# About Me:
I’m currently focused on building full-stack applications with a strong emphasis on React, Node.js, and MongoDB, where I’m refining CRUD operations tailored for social media platforms. I’m eager to collaborate on innovative full-stack projects that allow me to leverage both my frontend and backend expertise, particularly those with a clean, minimalist design approach. I’m seeking guidance on optimizing backend performance, implementing best practices for API integrations, and enhancing data validation techniques. Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by diving into React Native for cross-platform development and deepening my knowledge of advanced backend architecture. Feel free to ask me about designing minimalistic user interfaces, creating engaging animations using After Effects, or building scalable backend systems. A fun fact about me: I’ve been passionate about hiking and gaming since childhood, and I enjoy creatively integrating these themes into my projects!
