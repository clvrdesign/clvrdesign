# About Me:
I’m currently focused on building full-stack applications with a strong emphasis on Nextjs & Tailwind css, Expressjs & Postgresql.
I’m eager to collaborate on innovative full-stack projects that allow me to leverage both my frontend and backend expertise, particularly those with a clean, minimalist design approach.<br>

Feel free to ask me about designing minimalistic user interfaces, or building scalable backend systems.
