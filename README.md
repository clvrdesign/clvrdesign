# About Me:
I’m currently focused on building full-stack applications with a strong emphasis on Nextjs, Node.js, and Postgresql, where I’m refining CRUD operations tailored for social media platforms.
I’m eager to collaborate on innovative full-stack projects that allow me to leverage both my frontend and backend expertise, particularly those with a clean, minimalist design approach.<br>
I’m seeking guidance on optimizing backend performance, implementing best practices for API integrations, and enhancing data validation techniques.<br><br>

Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by diving into React Native for cross-platform development and deepening my knowledge of advanced backend architecture.<br>
Feel free to ask me about designing minimalistic user interfaces, creating engaging animations using After Effects, or building scalable backend systems.
